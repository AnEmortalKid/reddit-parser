The case of the Baker	 Every morn' before the sun is risen. Fresh, warm bread appears in the village. This impoverished village has no baker, nor a proper oven. Too far from the city to maintain its warmth, the masterwork bread that appears... Only where none are looking.

The shifting Church	 A quiet corner of town a church stands, every morning it worships a different god, with different disciples and a drastically different interior.

The grocer on the corner	 An old man running the grocer on the corner, never seen to leave. Nor any supplies ever arrive, the shop is however fully stocked regardless of how much custom he has.

The screaming hospital children	 The hospital is plagued in the darkest parts of the night by the screams of children. The wards sleep soundly. Many have searched for the source of the screams, but they seem to come from all around.
The Kings Sun	 Visitors of the King's castle note that the sun always shines behind him. In the magnificent stained glass throne room the Kings face is always drowned out by the sun behind him. Even in clouds or low sun, the room is always lit the same.
The Upward Path	 A stretch of road in the middle of nowhere, objects roll uphill, caravans are to superstitious to use it.

The River Woman	 The rivers here run fast, a popular place for many to end their lives. However many who come for that reason see a woman across the river, the woman has a face of anguish. The observers of this woman become overrun with guilt and return home.
The Fire in the Desert	 This desert is a vast an empty place, barely a cactus breaks up the rolling dunes. During the night a faint orange glow is seen behind many of the dunes.
The call of the past	 The port has reported from time to time, and empty boat floats into harbor. In the boat, a single bottle of what appears to be wine rests in the center. None have dared to taste it, and the bottles only build up. A opening in the trees, just outside the settlement, odd sounds can be heard. People hear what they heard before the last time they slept.

The Conundrum of the Cat	 Wherever the party goes, one of their number keeps seeing the same black cat. It's impossible it can be a coincidence, for the cat they keep seeing has a distinct crescent of white fur on its forehead. No matter how hard they look, they never spot it following them from place to place, and if they search they never find it hiding amidst the wagons of any caravan they might join. But no matter where they travel (even on other planes), no matter how quickly they manage to get there (even by teleportation), it is always there first. Every time it appears, the situation is such that the only person who has line of sight to the cat is the one character who always sees it. To the other characters the cat is a mere figment, and a cause for worry about the mental health of their friend.
The Enigma of the Evil Eye	 The city of Skarsdale is cursed; the symbol of the Evil Eye keeps appearing around the city. Burned into a wooden windowsill. As frost on a window in winter. Baked into bread. Items knocked over fall into the shape of it. It's never done deliberately (who would do that?) and it's appearances are seemingly random, all except one. Every morning, without exception, the eye is daubed in blood on the city-facing wall of Skarsdale Castle, above the drawbridge. Even when watched all night, the mark appears as if by magic - but no magic is detected.
The Mystery of the Melody	 A song can be heard drifting across the city at night, but only by a handful of people. Without fail, those people abandon their lives the very next morning to go off and realise their unfulfilled dreams.
The Problem of the Pants that Walked	 The people of Hollowbrook have a problem - they are running out of clothes. As of a week ago, any clothes left unworn (for instance, when hanging to dry after being washed) rise up into the air, pulling and allowing themselves to be ripped if need be to escape. They gather together as raggamoffyns (constructs composed of scraps of cloth - see The 3rd edition Monster Manual II or google for more info).
The Puzzle of the Pupils	 The little mountain town of Urmster is a happy one. Everyone is friendly, and treats each other like family. It seems idyllic, and a visitor has a perfectly wonderful time there, enjoying the ambience, the hot springs, and the many beautiful local walks. Yet a perceptive visitor may notice,ever so occasionally, the glimpse of something strange in the pupils of the townsfolk. Here one minute, gone the next, it's easy to think you imagined it: the very image of the townsperson, reflected in their own eye.
The Obfuscation of the Occult	 On the third day of the third week of each month, spellcasters throughout the kingdom mysteriously misremember all their lore, spells, and rituals. Any attempt to use magic on this day results in mayhem, and may possibly be dangerous (treat as wild magic surge).
The Quandary of the Queue	 While passing through town one day, the party see a queue of people backed up from a door in the wall. There is no signage to suggest what might be beyond the door. Hundreds of people are waiting to get in, and the queue goes right round the corner of the street. When they return this way they see the queue looking just as long. Close observation shows that every time someone goes through the door, which happens every two minutes and thirty seven seconds another person joins the back of the queue. Furthermore, they are the same people, on a repeating cycle. Yet no one comes out of the door and there is no rear entrance. If they try to get closer to the door to see what's inside, the people in the queue accuse them of queue-jumping and get belligerent, forming up as a mob to prevent the PCs skipping the line. If the party back up, they return exactly to their correct places in the queue.
The Question of the Queen's Betrothal	 The Queen is getting married! The only thing is, no one seems to know where her mysterious suitor Lord Abgarde came from, and no one even seems curious. The party are sought out by one of the castle's kitchen maids, who was away from the town caring for her dying father on the night the engagement was announced. When she returned to the castle, she found it was as though Lord Abgarde had always been there and everyone thought his engagement to the The Queen had lasted an entire year. Only she could see things as they truly were. The party, like everyone else in the city, have false memories regarding the bethrothal (ideally set this up so that the players themselves have no reason to believe her. Do this WAY in advance by feeding them news from the castle, or if they visit, letting them see Lord Abgarde. They should really question whether or not these memories are false).
The Riddle of the Raider's Ship	 The people of Greenvale woke morning to find their sheep grazing contentedly around the hull of a sailing vessel with the flag of the East Island Raiders, mysterious transported onto the chalk downs. The pirate crew were all dead, their bodies each laid out on the grass nearby, one hand outstretched Eastward - perhaps toward the ocean, fully five hundred miles away. The Raiders spoils was left untouched in the cargo hold, and a scrawled note pinned to one of the chests by dagger: Though these men will wrong you yet You must see and not forget Their captain will be your own get Heed this lesson or your fates are set.
The Secret of the Sauce	 After tasting the meatballs at a particular roadside inn, Ikea's Table (named after the fabled table of the goddess of home and hearth, Ikea) the party feel compelled to return there as regularly as possible for more of the dish. If asked why it is so good, the innkeeper's wife (also the cook) will only say that it's all thanks to her secret sauce. There is nothing magical about the food.

Pants!?	 No one in town owns any pants, every time someone brings a pair they disappear by the next morning. The tailor has completely given up making new pairs.

Who's lying, and what happens when he turns too blurry...
The Adjudicator	 A wizard is willing to give the highest bidder her greatest desires and wishes. What is on auction? The bidders' hopes, dreams, sanity, loved ones, life, and lineage. Who are the contestants? Who is the wizard? What are the shadowy figures backstage?
Red Dream	 Last night, the party had a strange dream. A plump man in crimson and gold robes stood in the middle of a village chanting inaudibly. In the middle of the keep around you, there is a shiny bright green half-helm the size of a merchant wagon burning high into the sky. The standards around you show a field of blue with a white and black tower. A crowd chants, "Nemesio, Nemesio, Nemesio" in a building crescendo. You all awake, and the sky has turned red as far as you can see.
Sing song ding dong	 Everyone in the little village is all smiles, day and night. The town sings and dances to a tune no-one in the party can hear, performing on the streets, in impromptu fashion, before going back to their daily duties humming and shaking to the beat. The birds chirp in tune, and the bushes rustle like shakers when the wind blows just right. What's the name of the bard they keep repeating in the song? The one with the incredibly rhyme-able name?
The Book of Confusion	 A book is found in a king's library, but upon first examination, there are no words upon the pages. After flipping through the pages for a certain amount of time, the reader cannot tear themselves away from the book, nor attempt to communicate what is inside the book. If the book is taken away from the reader, the reader will usually kill themselves within a month.

The Case of the Open Windows	 The party has been in a town frequently and they've been hearing about prominent figures in the locality suddenly dying of blunt force trauma. The only real connection between all of them, besides them being well known in the town, is the open window in the room they're found.
Stoneveil	 A small town of gorgeous, porcelain-skinned people, nestled in a mountain's foothills has been shaken with the sudden petrification of some of the pillars of the community.
