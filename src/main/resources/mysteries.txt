The case of the Baker	 Every morn' before the sun is risen. Fresh, warm bread appears in the village. This impoverished village has no baker, nor a proper oven. Too far from the city to maintain its warmth, the masterwork bread that appears... Only where none are looking.
The Tireless Spinning Wheel	 Across the river in a secluded grove, there is a rickety spinning wheel doing its work. Clackety clack! Clackety clack! It yields no thread, only the omnipresent sound...Clackety clack! Clackety clack!
The Broken Puppet	 A traveling merchant has an intricate puppet that he refuses to sell. The puppet shares many of the same physical characteristics as the merchant. Did it just move?
The Final Chime	 The bells chime as you would expect during the day, but come midnight... It is always the same. Eight chimes. A pause, then bong... bong... bong... THUNK
Schroedinger's Kid	 Street urchins are a common sight in large cities. But this one strikes you as odd, you could have sworn you saw his corpse they day before, once again a week before that, and a month before that. And yet he still plays in the street.
The Restarting Village	 A common village by looks. Every time one visits a sense of deja vu is felt. When an outsider approaches, all continues as normal. When all outsiders leave, all goes back to the beginning.
The shifting Church	 A quiet corner of town a church stands, every morning it worships a different god, with different disciples and a drastically different interior.
The Flash	 Some evenings right before the end of sunset, as the top of the sun rests on the horizon. Strong flashes of light travel across the horizon, in perfect time and always the same direction.
The Roving Fairy Ring	 Fairy rings are a common sight, however this one moves several meters a day. It seems to have a path and ones who care for the mushrooms are said to be blessed with good fortune.
Tangled hair house	 An odd boarding house atop a hill, many visit, only those with short hair are ever seen to leave.
The grocer on the corner	 An old man running the grocer on the corner, never seen to leave. Nor any supplies ever arrive, the shop is however fully stocked regardless of how much custom he has.
The painted man	 Many have told this story. In a painting one sees a man staring out at them from the background, this crude figure will then be seen again and again. From other art to graffiti to drawings by children this figure is seen.
The screaming hospital children	 The hospital is plagued in the darkest parts of the night by the screams of children. The wards sleep soundly. Many have searched for the source of the screams, but they seem to come from all around.
The Kings Sun	 Visitors of the King's castle note that the sun always shines behind him. In the magnificent stained glass throne room the Kings face is always drowned out by the sun behind him. Even in clouds or low sun, the room is always lit the same.
Case of the vanished people	 In the village of Oxhead, housing 50 people, every day someone is missing, without trace. The next day, they're back, not remembering being gone at all and completely unchanged, and a new person has disappeared.
Riddle of the masked man	 Every morning at sunrise a masked person walks into town straight from the north, stands perfectly still until sunset, and walks on towards the south. He reappears the next day.
The lone rancher	 Out in the countryside there's a large grain farm, easily one of the largest in the area. Only a single person is found at the farm at work; an old emaciated man with long white beard. The farm runs splendidly and the old man insists he needs no help running it.
Come little children	 Yesterday, three children went into the woods to collect berries and did not return. During the night, a foul abysmal odour unlike anything imaginable permeated the town. The next day, the children came back... nine years older.
The Rain of Cadavers	 One night the inhabitants of the town of Bargrund woke up to see the carcasses of dead cows raining down on them from a clouded sky. The dead cows cause much damage and injury to structures and people and the clouds have a violet tint to them.
Case of the Eyes	 An unblinking humanoid eye the size of a football has appeared on people's doors on the side turning in, rooted into the wood by black tendrils. The eyes do nothing but stay where they are. Unblinking.
The King's Crown	 The royal crown of the palace belonging to a long line of monarchs has a habit of getting lost. It appears at random spots in the palace all the time, and disappears from where you last put it.
Cookies to the people	 This winter morning, every household in the entire realm woke to find a pile of cookies somewhere in the house. Even beggars, thieves, cultists and homeless people got them. They are quite delicious.
Gambling hazards	 Recently, the gamblers in town have experienced that every time a die rolls a 1, the next rolls automatically are 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 without fail. The die then behaves normally until another 1 is rolled. No-one knows what this means.
The sleeping giant	 A cloud giant appeared in the town square two months ago and has been sleeping ever since. All attempts to wake her has failed. She still breathes but hasn't moved.
Colour of love	 Every morning, a rose sprouts from the ground at a random spot in the city. Anyone and everyone within 60 feet of the rose fall in love with the last person they laid eyes upon. Every day the rose is in a new place.
The Silence of the Rats	 Recently, all rats in town has turned completely and utterly silent. No sound when they move, no squeaks or padding of rat feet. Nothing.
The Conundrum of the Cat	 Wherever the party goes, one of their number keeps seeing the same black cat. It's impossible it can be a coincidence, for the cat they keep seeing has a distinct crescent of white fur on its forehead. No matter how hard they look, they never spot it following them from place to place, and if they search they never find it hiding amidst the wagons of any caravan they might join. But no matter where they travel (even on other planes), no matter how quickly they manage to get there (even by teleportation), it is always there first. Every time it appears, the situation is such that the only person who has line of sight to the cat is the one character who always sees it. To the other characters the cat is a mere figment, and a cause for worry about the mental health of their friend.
The Enigma of the Evil Eye	 The city of Skarsdale is cursed; the symbol of the Evil Eye keeps appearing around the city. Burned into a wooden windowsill. As frost on a window in winter. Baked into bread. Items knocked over fall into the shape of it. It's never done deliberately (who would do that?) and it's appearances are seemingly random, all except one. Every morning, without exception, the eye is daubed in blood on the city-facing wall of Skarsdale Castle, above the drawbridge. Even when watched all night, the mark appears as if by magic - but no magic is detected.
The Mystery of the Melody	 A song can be heard drifting across the city at night, but only by a handful of people. Without fail, those people abandon their lives the very next morning to go off and realise their unfulfilled dreams.
The Problem of the Pants that Walked	 The people of Hollowbrook have a problem - they are running out of clothes. As of a week ago, any clothes left unworn (for instance, when hanging to dry after being washed) rise up into the air, pulling and allowing themselves to be ripped if need be to escape. They gather together as raggamoffyns (constructs composed of scraps of cloth - see The 3rd edition Monster Manual II or google for more info).
The Puzzle of the Pupils	 The little mountain town of Urmster is a happy one. Everyone is friendly, and treats each other like family. It seems idyllic, and a visitor has a perfectly wonderful time there, enjoying the ambience, the hot springs, and the many beautiful local walks. Yet a perceptive visitor may notice,ever so occasionally, the glimpse of something strange in the pupils of the townsfolk. Here one minute, gone the next, it's easy to think you imagined it: the very image of the townsperson, reflected in their own eye.
The Obfuscation of the Occult	 On the third day of the third week of each month, spellcasters throughout the kingdom mysteriously misremember all their lore, spells, and rituals. Any attempt to use magic on this day results in mayhem, and may possibly be dangerous (treat as wild magic surge).
The Quandary of the Queue	 While passing through town one day, the party see a queue of people backed up from a door in the wall. There is no signage to suggest what might be beyond the door. Hundreds of people are waiting to get in, and the queue goes right round the corner of the street. When they return this way they see the queue looking just as long. Close observation shows that every time someone goes through the door, which happens every two minutes and thirty seven seconds another person joins the back of the queue. Furthermore, they are the same people, on a repeating cycle. Yet no one comes out of the door and there is no rear entrance. If they try to get closer to the door to see what's inside, the people in the queue accuse them of queue-jumping and get belligerent, forming up as a mob to prevent the PCs skipping the line. If the party back up, they return exactly to their correct places in the queue.
The Question of the Queen's Betrothal	 The Queen is getting married! The only thing is, no one seems to know where her mysterious suitor Lord Abgarde came from, and no one even seems curious. The party are sought out by one of the castle's kitchen maids, who was away from the town caring for her dying father on the night the engagement was announced. When she returned to the castle, she found it was as though Lord Abgarde had always been there and everyone thought his engagement to the The Queen had lasted an entire year. Only she could see things as they truly were. The party, like everyone else in the city, have false memories regarding the bethrothal (ideally set this up so that the players themselves have no reason to believe her. Do this WAY in advance by feeding them news from the castle, or if they visit, letting them see Lord Abgarde. They should really question whether or not these memories are false).
The Riddle of the Raider's Ship	 The people of Greenvale woke morning to find their sheep grazing contentedly around the hull of a sailing vessel with the flag of the East Island Raiders. The pirate crew were all dead, their bodies each laid out on the grass nearby, one hand outstretched Eastward - perhaps toward the ocean, fully five hundred miles away. The Raiders spoils was left untouched in the cargo hold, and a scrawled note pinned to one of the chests by dagger: Though these men will wrong you yet You must see and not forget Their captain will be your own get Heed this lesson or your fates are set.
The Secret of the Sauce	 After tasting the meatballs at a particular roadside inn, Ikea's Table (named after the fabled table of the goddess of home and hearth, Ikea) the party feel compelled to return there as regularly as possible for more of the dish. If asked why it is so good, the innkeeper's wife (also the cook) will only say that it's all thanks to her secret sauce. There is nothing magical about the food.
