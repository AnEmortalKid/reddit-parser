The case of the Baker	 Every morn' before the sun is risen. Fresh, warm bread appears in the village. This impoverished village has no baker, nor a proper oven. Too far from the city to maintain its warmth, the masterwork bread that appears... Only where none are looking.

The painted man	 Many have told this story. In a painting one sees a man staring out at them from the background, this crude figure will then be seen again and again. From other art to graffiti to drawings by children this figure is seen.
The screaming hospital children	 The hospital is plagued in the darkest parts of the night by the screams of children. The wards sleep soundly. Many have searched for the source of the screams, but they seem to come from all around.

Spick & Span	 I never bother doing dishes anymore. Especially since they are spotless when I wake up!

The Final Chime	 The bells chime as you would expect during the day, but come midnight... It is always the same. Eight chimes. A pause, then bong... bong... bong... THUNK
The Hungry Book	 Attempting to write in this book is futile, as anything written in the tome slowly fades away, no matter how much ink is used, until it is blank again. Oh, and once it's done absorbing the ink it smacks its pages as if they were lips, quite a disconcerting sight.
The Razor Road	 This apparently plain cobblestone road in the forest looks innocent enough, but walk upon it, and it will feel as if you were walking on a bed of nails.
The Midnight Well	 Most of the time, this well gives out perfectly good drinking water. Sometimes however, the pail will return from the depths of the well filled with a viscous black liquid...

The Conundrum of the Cat	 Wherever the party goes, one of their number keeps seeing the same black cat. It's impossible it can be a coincidence, for the cat they keep seeing has a distinct crescent of white fur on its forehead. No matter how hard they look, they never spot it following them from place to place, and if they search they never find it hiding amidst the wagons of any caravan they might join. But no matter where they travel (even on other planes), no matter how quickly they manage to get there (even by teleportation), it is always there first. Every time it appears, the situation is such that the only person who has line of sight to the cat is the one character who always sees it. To the other characters the cat is a mere figment, and a cause for worry about the mental health of their friend.
The Enigma of the Evil Eye	 The city of Skarsdale is cursed; the symbol of the Evil Eye keeps appearing around the city. Burned into a wooden windowsill. As frost on a window in winter. Baked into bread. Items knocked over fall into the shape of it. It's never done deliberately (who would do that?) and it's appearances are seemingly random, all except one. Every morning, without exception, the eye is daubed in blood on the city-facing wall of Skarsdale Castle, above the drawbridge. Even when watched all night, the mark appears as if by magic - but no magic is detected.

The Problem of the Pants that Walked	 The people of Hollowbrook have a problem - they are running out of clothes. As of a week ago, any clothes left unworn (for instance, when hanging to dry after being washed) rise up into the air, pulling and allowing themselves to be ripped if need be to escape. They gather together as raggamoffyns (constructs composed of scraps of cloth - see The 3rd edition Monster Manual II or google for more info).
The Puzzle of the Pupils	 The little mountain town of Urmster is a happy one. Everyone is friendly, and treats each other like family. It seems idyllic, and a visitor has a perfectly wonderful time there, enjoying the ambience, the hot springs, and the many beautiful local walks. Yet a perceptive visitor may notice,ever so occasionally, the glimpse of something strange in the pupils of the townsfolk. Here one minute, gone the next, it's easy to think you imagined it: the very image of the townsperson, reflected in their own eye.
The Quandary of the Queue	 While passing through town one day, the party see a queue of people backed up from a door in the wall. There is no signage to suggest what might be beyond the door. Hundreds of people are waiting to get in, and the queue goes right round the corner of the street. When they return this way they see the queue looking just as long. Close observation shows that every time someone goes through the door, which happens every two minutes and thirty seven seconds another person joins the back of the queue. Furthermore, they are the same people, on a repeating cycle. Yet no one comes out of the door and there is no rear entrance. If they try to get closer to the door to see what's inside, the people in the queue accuse them of queue-jumping and get belligerent, forming up as a mob to prevent the PCs skipping the line. If the party back up, they return exactly to their correct places in the queue.
The Question of the Queen's Betrothal	 The Queen is getting married! The only thing is, no one seems to know where her mysterious suitor Lord Abgarde came from, and no one even seems curious. The party are sought out by one of the castle's kitchen maids, who was away from the town caring for her dying father on the night the engagement was announced. When she returned to the castle, she found it was as though Lord Abgarde had always been there and everyone thought his engagement to the The Queen had lasted an entire year. Only she could see things as they truly were. The party, like everyone else in the city, have false memories regarding the bethrothal (ideally set this up so that the players themselves have no reason to believe her. Do this WAY in advance by feeding them news from the castle, or if they visit, letting them see Lord Abgarde. They should really question whether or not these memories are false).
The Riddle of the Raider's Ship	 The people of Greenvale woke morning to find their sheep grazing contentedly around the hull of a sailing vessel with the flag of the East Island Raiders, mysterious transported onto the chalk downs. The pirate crew were all dead, their bodies each laid out on the grass nearby, one hand outstretched Eastward - perhaps toward the ocean, fully five hundred miles away. The Raiders spoils was left untouched in the cargo hold, and a scrawled note pinned to one of the chests by dagger: Though these men will wrong you yet You must see and not forget Their captain will be your own get Heed this lesson or your fates are set.
The Secret of the Sauce	 After tasting the meatballs at a particular roadside inn, Ikea's Table (named after the fabled table of the goddess of home and hearth, Ikea) the party feel compelled to return there as regularly as possible for more of the dish. If asked why it is so good, the innkeeper's wife (also the cook) will only say that it's all thanks to her secret sauce. There is nothing magical about the food.

Laughing Disease	 Everyone who enters the city starts to laugh uncontrollably, only the locals are immune, and they violently expel any outsiders and rob them of all their possessions. All the while screaming about how it's not funny, and the laughter is an insult to them, and this is their punishment for mocking the town.

After flipping through the pages for a certain amount of time, the reader cannot tear themselves away from the book, nor attempt to communicate what is inside the book. If the book is taken away from the reader, the reader will usually kill themselves within a month.

The Case of the Open Windows	 The party has been in a town frequently and they've been hearing about prominent figures in the locality suddenly dying of blunt force trauma. The only real connection between all of them, besides them being well known in the town, is the open window in the room they're found.

The Inscrutable Judge	 Locals fear and revere an ancient marble statue of a stern headsman, that stands beside the road at one end of the only bridge in miles. Most travellers pass without incident, but in one in a thousand cases the statue springs angrily to life and decapitates a horrified passerby with its enormous razor-edged stone axe, before settling back into its previous pose. No pattern has yet been found in these attacks.
The Coin Sowers	 A village has been blessed for many years with unusually bountiful harvests, even while other farmland nearby has been struck with famine.

Red Dream	 Last night, the party had a strange dream. A plump man in crimson and gold robes stood in the middle of a village chanting inaudibly. In the middle of the keep around you, there is a shiny bright green half-helm the size of a merchant wagon burning high into the sky. The standards around you show a field of blue with a white and black tower. A crowd chants, "Nemesio, Nemesio, Nemesio" in a building crescendo. You all awake, and the sky has turned red as far as you can see.
Sing song ding dong	 Everyone in the little village is all smiles, day and night. The town sings and dances to a tune no-one in the party can hear, performing on the streets, in impromptu fashion, before going back to their daily duties humming and shaking to the beat.

At dusk, he gives a final sigh of satisfaction before stiffening and toppling over, usually breaking into many pieces from the fall.
Weeping Willows	 A small copse of trees stands in a desolate old field full of dried grasses. From each long branch drips a golden, sweet fluid that is warming and rejuvenating to the taste. Any who drink it directly from the tree are unusually productive for 24 hours, followed by 48 hours of depression and desolation. Bottling the fluid removes this effect, though it retains the taste of sweet morning dew.

He experiences weird nose bleeds, and occasionally, his eyes grow red for seemingly no reason.

The Seeing Ring	 A simple silver band with a black opal setting in the center. When put on, the ring sheds an unnatural warmth. The stone spins, revealing an eye that stares at the wearer.

A lively dream	 A village has suddenly started having bad dreams. They all seem to be able to remember clips from their dream and it all has the same theme. Soon the dreams are exactly the same.

Soon after that, the monsters are shadows, but can be looked at directly, then they start killing.
Hide and Squeak	 All the rats in the city have mysteriously vanished. This seemed a good thing, until piles of dead rat-bitten cats were found last month, and the cities food stores have begun depleting at an unexplainable rate. Last week all the former rat-killers vanished from their beds. And now, every night at the stroke of midnight, an eery otherworldly bell can be heard tolling from somewhere deep under the city.

The Innocent Rat Plague	 There are no rat-holes in plain sight anywhere to be found in town, no horrible stench or diseases run rampant and food will never go missing when left unattended. But whenever an old floorboard is replaced, a patch of dirt is disturbed or a particularly old piece of furniture needs to be moved, at least one rat always seems to be hiding just there and they always seem to get away through some small crack or hole somewhere.
The Adventurer's Respite	 There's a small hut on a hill besides the road, far away from any town or city. When travellers pass by they will always see a warm, orange light coming through a window and smell a mouthwatering smell of freshly cooked supper wafting towards them. The lady of the house, whose husband will likely be home late today, will always welcome weary travellers, offering them a place by the hearth, a wonderful meal and a soft bed for the night. All who go to sleep in the hut will wake up the next morning in rotten, lice-infested sheets in the wooden ruins of something that must have been a home many, many years ago, the decaying and brittle skeleton of whoever once lived here still lying on the muddy floor by the hearth.
The Quiet Village	 This tiny village is contained within wooden palisade walls, ending at two usually open gates at the front and back. No sound can be heard from the village, and once you pass through its gates, no sound can be heard at all. A pan banging next to your ear is as silent as anything could ever be. This effect exists only within these wooden walls, and none of the townsfolk seem to notice.
A Sea of Dirt	 This empty town is devoid of life, but all its buildings and items remain intact. By day, it's a spot where a traveler can rest his weary head in a featherbed once belonging to some noble, or find a treasure of some kind that a blacksmith had tucked away. By night, the ground changes. Living things that touch the ground fall into it like a stone into water, and no amount of swimming can save them; they are pulled down into the unknown. The buildings are away from one another, making it hard to get from place to place. The town will not let you leave without a fight.
The Missing Parents	 There are no adults in this village. The kids rule in their place, and though they do not do the things that adults would do, they seem to be surviving fine. Nearby towns have not reported any of their adults coming to them, nor has anyone seen a sign from them. The only clue you have to go on is the ferocity by which the children protect the town hall's basement...
Liturgy to the Dead	 In the woods there sits a black stone, dark as night, and large as ten men on each other's shoulders. On the plateau of this rock stands ten people in a circle, old and young, men and women, and of different races. They do not acknowledge the presence of any who disturb them, and cannot be moved from the spot they stand in. In the center of their circle sits a second black stone in the shape of an egg. As day night falls and day breaks, they are unchanged. Now, though, there are only nine.
The Mad Hatter	 At a local haberdashery, a hatter creates works that astonish and amaze even the most sophisticated of hat enthusiasts. No matter what price he sells them for, people fight to be the one to buy them. What seems odd, though, is the faint magical aura on each hat that nobody else seems to see. What caught your attention was that the aura felt a lot like an undead...
The Monk in the Field	 In the middle of this field sits a monk, whose strong powers can be felt a mile away. There is nothing but grass around him on all sides but one; in front of him sits a forest. This monk is engaged in heavy prayer, a ritual perhaps, and cannot move or speak. From his tattered cloths and the growth around him it appears he's been at this for a very long time, years maybe, sustained by some otherworldly force. All you know is, the more you look at the forest, the heavier you feel, and the more inclined you feel to stopping this man's prayers.
Lost and found	 A little box on the corner of a street in a small, otherwise unremarkable fishing town. Nothing special per se, where it not that objects inside always find their original owner, and have included everything from solitary socks to priceless artifacts and even the kings wedding ring.
A beggar and a thief	 a simple beggar known as richie. People who come in contact often lose things, you could toss him a coin and find your earrings gone. Often accused, he's been frisked more than you could count, but never have any of the objects been found. He still sits on the same corner every day, not a coin to his name, watched closely, called a beggar and a thief daily.
The calmest place on earth	 A small shack in a region tormented by the elements. 3 floods, a forest fire, 4 tornadoes and an earthquake later, nothing of the surroundings looks the same, yet the small shack still stands, untouched by nature.
The waypoint	 A non-magical rock, often used by travellers as a waypoint due to it's recognisable shape. Although you're pretty sure it was standing in the woods last time you saw it, not in the middle of a corn field..
The knocking	 There are lots of tales of people dying peacefully in their sleep, with eyewitnesses saying the night before, the deceased got up and opened the door, reacting to a knock only they could hear.
Welcome to shlaad	 Visitors in shlaad can often be seen carrying a pamphlet with touristic information. Noone in shlaad has ever worked on them, handed them out, or even got one directly. They just lie around, always perfectly up to date, including events only just concieved and changes that happened the same day.
I Know That Guy!	 Every inn or tavern in every town, village, or city the adventurers go to has a bartender that looks and sounds exactly alike. He always goes by a different name, but everyone in the party recognizes him from each of the other places. No matter how hard he is questioned or interrogated, he has no idea what the adventurers are talking about if they confront him with it.
The Beekeeper's Daughter	 The girl was tending the bees near their cottage at the edge of the forest; whatever happened to her, she left no trace.
The Woodcutter's Axe	 Stan the woodcutter went outside to get to work, but his axe wasn't where he left it; he found it nearby, buried in the skull of a man he's never seen.
The Butcher, the Baker, and the Brothelkeeper	 A pair of local businessmen (the butcher and the baker) have been acting very strangely after a night of drunken revelry at Madame Biggs' brothel.
Oldtown Tavern	 The barkeep at the Oldtown Tavern swears the glasses keep rearranging themselves, and the barmaid saw something disturbing when tossing out the scraps in the back alley.
Dark Homecoming	 The secretive Steelmoon Academy was founded on the site of an ancient monastery a few decades ago. Pupils who were admitted to the school had never returned to their families. Last month, one did return...
The Bridge of Crabs	 On a thin strip of land separating two bodies of water , only a mile and half wide, sand continues away from the beach stretching across the land and connecting two the opposing beach. No trees or plants grow here, just a 100 yard wide desert bridge across the land.
Compass Jester's Fist	 On the road between here and the capitol, just off the road, a giant three fingered fist carved from some magnetic stone juts from the ground.
XXL Sweaters	 Someone or something is enlarging Farmer Greenbrows sheep to 3X their size.
The Battalion Tree	 A large old gnarled tree in the forest has a special property: when someone touches a gold coin to the tree, the sound of a 1000 swords unsheathing echo through the forest.
Druid Grove	 In these woods is a well maintained grove of trees of many different species. Some shouldn't even be in this climate. one trait they all share is the faces that rise out of the bark. All the faces maintain the look of peaceful slumber. All except for the very last tree, which bears no leaves, it's branches ending in scorched limbs. The face on this trunk is frozen in a scream of anguish.
Mystery Name	 Its like a statue or something. I guess it makes you procrastinate, I'll describe it better later.
The Kitchen Table Conch	 Instead of hearing the ocean or the sound of the blood in your own ears, once a day this conch emits a mundane conversation between a family. Mother, father, son, daughter, and grandma are all discussing their boring daily experiences.
One still cares	 A long dead necromancer is buried in the town cemetery. Every year on his birthday and anniversary of his death, someone leaves a tulip and a bottle of wine on his grave.
The Alley of Forgotten Toys	 People who walk down this alley late at night often find toys that they lost as children.
Back in a Little While	 I hope none of these are too similar to existing ones, but I'll give it a shot.   Tazniss Alley is a street in the slums of a large city. All emotional reactions are inverted there. Insults and crimes are met with generosity, while favors and compliments invoke disgust and outrage. Tragedies bring joy and good news causes despair.   Two professors from the local academy were found dead on a hill, wearing winter robes despite the summer heat and masks warded against magic. One held a note: "Fourth hour: Meet at the hill; Sixth hour: Ingest potions; await signal; don masks"   A week ago a family moved into town whose daughter has an imaginary friend named Mr. Daggers. Every day since then, a child has come home sobbing and shaking, swearing that their imaginary friend has been stabbed to death by a dagger-wielding killer.   Every one in town has met the mayor, but can't provide a single detail about their appearance. The locals joke about their leader's nondescript looks, but a few questions will make it apparent that their mayor is literally indescribable.   As a merchant was driving his wagon through town last week, a box fell from it and landed in the middle of the road. The locals have tried moving the obstruction, but though it seems to be a normal wooden box, it can't be opened and can't be moved.   The town is in a panic, as its food chain has been reversed. Cats are chasing dogs, rats are chasing cats, field mice and snakes are somehow dragging hawks out of the sky, and the townspeople find themselves hunted by all manner of game and cattle.   The town's buildings are slowly growing from their tops, at a rate of about one story per fortnight. No doors lead to the new rooms, but entering through the windows with a ladder will reveal that the completed stories are furnished and show signs of use.   The city's twelve bards are having a feud. "The Dreamer's Ditty" is the city's most popular new song, first heard in twelve separate inns on the same hour of the same night, but each inn's bard claims to have written it, and all appear sincere.   Everything known to any of the town's children is known to all of the town's children. The children see nothing unusual about this, explaining matter-of-factly that they "hear from each other" through their "third ears."   Throughout the town, seemingly happy people have been telling loved ones "wait for me a while" or "I'll be back in a bit," then killing themselves. Days later, the graves of some who have died this way have been found open and empty.
Spider Town	 A halfling village, far from major cities, is draped in webs. The townsfolk live in harmony with the spiders, but what do they need protection from?
Lost Generation	 It's harvest time, and all the villagers are gathered in town for a brief harvest ceremony. There are more women than men. There seem to be no young men between about 18-23 years old.
Frozen Village	 Out in the mountains; people out and about on daily errands -- frozen in place, some mid step; unmoving and unaware.
Nursery Rhyme	 The children sing a strange little rhyme. Everyone knows the words and no one knows where it came from. Probably from some long-lost wet nurse. Why then does the ruling council cringe when they hear it? And who is the foolish king the rhyme tells of?
Wonderous Outhouse	 This outhouse seems shabby on the outside, but inside it smells of mountain air and meadow flowers. A washbasin seems to fill itself and waste and feces seem to disappear down the hole.
Glittering Cloud	 Out over the ocean there's a massive cloud that doesn't travel exactly with the wind. Staring at it sometimes yields a glimpse of something glittering.
Woman's Word	 A local slang word can't be heard by men or boys.
Taste of Darkness	 Recently when the sun goes down in the city, food and drink acquires a peculiar aftertaste.
Mismatched Mansion	 Walking around the grounds outside, the East Wing of the mansion is much larger than it seems on the inside. The West Wing has an extra story on the inside than can be seen from outside.
Buzzing Hills	 The hills seem to emit a faint buzz, until you get too close to them.
Locked Room in the Lords Manner	 The local lord has a room in his castle he has never been able to open. What lies beyond?
The Hungry Prison	 Each day a prisoner vanishes. The other guards refuse to talk about it, its clear they arent escaping so whats going on? (hint for DMs: Google DnD house hunter).
The strange grandson	 The team collects rare ingrediants for an old wizard. Then they meet his oddly wise grandson who wants them to do even more jobs.

The Tower of the Gods	 A strange tower emerged recently. Though everyone seems to think it was always there. What strange tidings await inside?
Reality is not what it used to be	 Children born in a certain village seem to have strange abilities. Reality warping magic.
Mirror Town	 Right next to each other sit two cities. Exactly the reflection of the other down to the people. They say twins are always born. Each the exact opposite of the other. Who can you trust? (PS for extra fun give the good guys goatees, they will never see that coming).
The tree of worlds	 Inside this small tree there are portals to many other realms. Or are they?
The Lost Archives	 A library as large as a city once existed, containing all the knowledge of the sentient races. However someone lost the map and now its nowhere to be found. How did they lose something so important?
The Endless War and the Murdered King	 In a small valley there exists a war that never ends. Those that worship the sun against those that worship the moon. Why does it never end? They are all cursed with immortality. Yet people keep attempting to murder the kings. who would do this and why?
Citizens Watch	 Lots of people come in and out of town on a regular basis, but there is always someone who, despite whatever else they have going on, stands at the gate and watches the horizon. This watch lasts anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, but the watchman/woman is hardly ever inconvenienced by taking this time. It is almost never the same person, rarely is it anyone who seems ready for combat, and they take their watch almost without missing a step, like they came to the city gate just to stand guard. No one ever speaks while on this watch, but they do pay attention to the events unfolding around them. Anyone touched or attacked immediately snaps out of this watch and is normally aware of whoever shook them from their watch. No one ever has a clear reason for why they are taking watch, just that "they thought they might have seen something"
Growing pains	 Screams are heard in the middle of the night, random body parts growing bigger during the night. This invites the worst kind of tourists.
Blind luck	 Anything can happen on the mountain, as long as nobody is not looking.
Sharp dressed man	 An order of shoes arrive in town with buyers names and 'prices' attached, all of which desperately in need of shoeing.
Not even half the woman you are!	 A half (literally) woman appears at night stealing still pregnant women' unborn children. She appears to each person as themselves.
Tall tales	 Any story or reason you can tell an old lady, has already been told to her before, she can't remember by who though, she knows the story and how it ends.
Evolution	 There is a species of creature that evolves immediately under threat. Everyone is too scared to chase it down lest it evolve into something that eats them.
Undying	 An ancient cave can transfer a sickness from one to another, but never back.
That's heavy	 Things seem randomly weigh different from day to day, creating an interesting lifestyle for those living in the area.
The Wandering Marsh	 While travelling through a stretch of forest, adventurers pass through many small valleys where the ground is damp and the foliage is dead. Wherever they go, a swamp seems to block their path. When they backtrack, they find a swamp where there was none.
Divorce	 Upon entering the village, one notices the air is still and there is strange dust covering nearly everything, even the people. The villagers claim many of their kind simply vanished and they are unable to leave the village grounds - they reappear on the other side when entering the nearby woods. The adventurers go to the nearby river past the tree-line and find an old dock with a shack and rowboat. Across the river is the exact same shack and boat, imperfections and all. Heading across the river, they find the exact same village mirrored and all the missing people from the first village.
The Silence	 While travelling, the adventurers sometimes find themselves in a nearby place with no recollection of going there, often out of breath & with their weapons drawn.
My Child	 In a small village, a mother has just given birth to her 7th, but only child; the first died at 1-month, the 2nd at 2 months, the 3rd at 4 months, the 4th at 8 months and the 5th after a year and a half & the 6th after 3 years. The 7th child is now 5 years old and looks identical to all the others. It also seems to remember the lives of its lost siblings.
