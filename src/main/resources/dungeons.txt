Witch Hunt	Trap/Torture maze	 As the adventurers walk through a forest they encounter twin brothers, one with a pitchfork and the other with a torch and shortsword.

The brothers will explain that there are witches living in a cabin in the forest who have been abducting members of their village and they intend to put a stop to it once and for all, inviting the party members to join them on their hunt. If the party does not accept the invitation, the brothers will continue on their way peacefully. If the party accepts the invitation, the brothers will lead them down the path to the witch cabin. They will crouch at the edge of the woods to observe the cabin, whispering tales of the witches’ kidnappings and evil deeds to the party. After a short time observing the cabin, the brothers will state that the witches must be out and that it would be best to wait inside and ambush them upon returning. The brothers will lead the party into the house, suspiciously looking around at the insides. If the PCs perform a search of the cabin, they can easily find a trap door which leads to the basement. The brothers will otherwise find the trap door and suggest that they go into the basement to wait for the witches so that they aren’t seen through the windows, and they will lead the way down. Once the entire party has entered the basement, the brothers will look around suspiciously, waving their torch. They turn toward the party and smile as their disguises melt away and they reveal themselves as the witches and they will be hunting the party. The basement goes dark, leaving the party to illuminate their own way and two cackling female voices will echo through the labyrinthine dungeon/basement. “We’re on a witch hunt… a witch hunt.” “A witch hunt a witch hunt...” “Run run run run...” as the witches run away from the party before combat begins. The dungeon will be played by the board game “Labrynth” with the PCs arranged in the center of the board and the witches dispersed. The witch monsters can each use their action to shift the rows and columns of the dungeon by placing a single random square. This ability has a three round cooldown (the dungeon can only reform once every three rounds). After the witches are defeated, the walls crumble away, leaving a grid of columns underneath the house with the illuminated ladder in the center of the game board. Monsters: 2 Hags
