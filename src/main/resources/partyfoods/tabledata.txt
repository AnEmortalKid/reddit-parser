<tr>
<td>Silly Steak</td>
<td> This dwarven ribeye is marinated in strong mead before it's cooked. It gets its name from the fact that most of the alcohol doesn't burn off, leaving those who eat it more drunk than a whole mug of ale could have made them</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Beholder Beer</td>
<td> When drinking this extremely alcoholic beverage, made from beholder tears and thus quite a rarity, the drinker finds ugly people attractive and attractive people ugly.

<tr>
<td>Dragon Balls</td>
<td> Perhaps one of the strangest names for any food, these delectable meatballs made from dragon meat are served only at the finest of celebrations (mostly because dragon meat isn't easy to get).

<tr>
<td>Passionfire Fruit Spritzer</td>
<td> A clear, carbonated drink carefully made by combining the juice of the passionfire fruit and water in a crystal vessel. When shaken, golden sparks dance across the surface of the water, casting an orange glow across the drink. It is effervescent and gently pops in the mouth like raindrops against the tongue, then warms the heart despite the drink typically being served chilled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hot Dire Wolf</td>
<td> A common tavern food made from the composite ground parts of dire wolves that are otherwise often discarded due to being too tough or sinewy to eat. The mash is heavily spiced before being roasted, then stuffed in bread. Due to being spiced and stuffed in bread, it is easy to carry, highly nutritious, and does not spoil quickly -- an excellent choice of rations for the busy adventurer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Laughy Taffy</td>
<td> A popular, chewy carnival treat that causes the eater to laugh whenever it is chewed on. While popularly dyed pink and fruit flavored, Laughy Taffy can be found in myriads of colors and flavors. Is the carnival actually that fun, or is it just the Laughy Taffy?</td>

<td>Prismatic Chews</td>
<td> Small squares of soft candy that taste different the longer you chew on them. Produce juice when chewed and changes colour while chewed. Each colour lasts for 1 minute.

 <li>Orange - 'Sour Orange'</li>
 <li>Yellow - 'Popping Candy Lemon'</li>
 <li>Green - 'Bittersweet Lime'</li>
 <li>Blue - 'Cool Mint'. Palette Cleanser. Effect: Breath Freshener.</li>
 <li>Indigo - 'Sweet Blackberry'. Effect: Analgesic.</li>
 <li>Violet - 'Dark Grape'. Wine flavoured. Effect: Intoxicating.</li>
 Continuing to chew after the Voilet stage causes further intoxication, at about the rate of a glass of wine an hour.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stewed Bat and Vegetables</td>
<td> Bats are an omen of death, and are eaten whole to "scare death away". During cooking, bats have a strong odor similar to urine, so garlic, onion, chili pepper, or other aromatic ingredients are added during the process. It is sometimes of the Giant Bat variety, in which case the bat is sliced prior to being stewed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Skyglass Wine</td>
<td> A clear, light blue liquid made in a unique distillation process using skyglass, a rare and magically reactive material. The secrets of its creation are viciously guarded by the Doreila family and their wineries in the Korian Desert, the only known area where skyglass can be found. Imbibing the wine infuses one with a small amount of residual magic that, when consumed in the right amounts, is said to enable one to see the flow of magic with their bare eyes. Drinking enough skyglass wine to become intoxicated (failing a CON save) forcibly casts Detect Magic on the user for one minute.</td>
