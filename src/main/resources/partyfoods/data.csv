Bulette Bites,	 These chocolate treats are shaped like Bulettes, and have chunks of hard grey candy pressed into their backs and skulls to resemble their signature armor.
Silly Steak,	 This dwarven ribeye is marinated in strong mead before it's cooked. It gets its name from the fact that most of the alcohol doesn't burn off, leaving those who eat it more drunk than a whole mug of ale could have made them
Beholder Beer,	 When drinking this extremely alcoholic beverage, made from beholder tears and thus quite a rarity, the drinker finds ugly people attractive and attractive people ugly. First brewed by Lord Alicard Dervas for the purpose of siring an heir, Lord Dervas is quoted as saying "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but getting him to cry is the hard part!"
Dragon Balls,	 Perhaps one of the strangest names for any food, these delectable meatballs made from dragon meat are served only at the finest of celebrations (mostly because dragon meat isn't easy to get). The meatballs are made using ground dragon meat, two eggs, and a hearty amount of spice. Spicy and succulent, they're a fan favorite.
Passionfire Fruit Spritzer,	 A clear, carbonated drink carefully made by combining the juice of the passionfire fruit and water in a crystal vessel. When shaken, golden sparks dance across the surface of the water, casting an orange glow across the drink. It is effervescent and gently pops in the mouth like raindrops against the tongue, then warms the heart despite the drink typically being served chilled.
Hot Dire Wolf,	 A common tavern food made from the composite ground parts of dire wolves that are otherwise often discarded due to being too tough or sinewy to eat. The mash is heavily spiced before being roasted, then stuffed in bread. Due to being spiced and stuffed in bread, it is easy to carry, highly nutritious, and does not spoil quickly -- an excellent choice of rations for the busy adventurer.
Laughy Taffy,	 A popular, chewy carnival treat that causes the eater to laugh whenever it is chewed on. While popularly dyed pink and fruit flavored, Laughy Taffy can be found in myriads of colors and flavors. Is the carnival actually that fun, or is it just the Laughy Taffy?
Basilisk's Brew,	 A popular drink made combining ale with the sweet-but-toxic honey of the Basilisk Bee. While it tastes like mead, imbibing it creates a tingling rush in the mouth... followed by possible numbing.
Jelly Mint Cubes,	 One inch square cubes of mint flavoured blancmange. Enchanted to have non-living motion to slowly move around a plate, engulfing and devouring chocolate-chips. Taste of mint-choc-chip.
Mageish Delight,	 Small Tetrahedral pyramids, one inch on an edge, of lightly frosted purple jelly that glow from the inside. Taste of whatever you verbally declare immediately before eating.
Prismatic Chews,	 Small squares of soft candy that taste different the longer you chew on them. Produce juice when chewed and changes colour while chewed. Each colour lasts for 1 minute. Colour stops changing once you consume (or spit out) the chew. Tastes linger for five minutes, effects last for 1 hour. Colours go through the following stages: <li>Red - 'Spicy Strawberry'</li>
 <li>Orange - 'Sour Orange'</li>
 <li>Yellow - 'Popping Candy Lemon'</li>
 <li>Green - 'Bittersweet Lime'</li>
 <li>Blue - 'Cool Mint'. Palette Cleanser. Effect: Breath Freshener.</li>
 <li>Indigo - 'Sweet Blackberry'. Effect: Analgesic.</li>
 <li>Violet - 'Dark Grape'. Wine flavoured. Effect: Intoxicating.</li>
 Continuing to chew after the Voilet stage causes further intoxication, at about the rate of a glass of wine an hour.
Buffet Golem,	 A 1 foot tall silver Golem that takes buffet orders and sandwich orders, can recognise and understand commands to fill out a plate of food for a guest based on vague or complex orders and dietary restrictions. Can make sandwiches to order. Magically bound to a buffet table or serving area no larger than can be contained by a 10 x 10 x 10 feet cube. Requires physical access to ingredients. Can be instructed to ring a bell, raise small flag or pull a lever to request more ingredients or be commanded to follow other simple instructions.
Angel Wings,	 Spicy buffalo wings with flight dust mixed in. Eat 3 and you can levitate. 6 and you can fly as you'd like! Especially fun for party pranks, eat a few and jump off the balcony to really get the party started!
Silly Taffy,	 Eat one delicious piece of saltwater taffy and turn the color of that piece for a short period of time! Also functions as a useful disguise for tieflings and other colorful races.
Salt Moss,	 A common form of moss that grows in underground caverns typically inhabited by Dwarves. This moss is high in nutrients and Dwarves frequently wrap roasted pork and sausage in it.
Spice-Glaze Carrots,	 A spice-infused carrot, sweet at first before an individual's tastebuds pick up the aroma of cinnamon and saffron. Generally favored by human and halfling nobles.
Kraken Platter,	 A chocolate graham cracker baked to look like a square shield, with a silver colored icing trim. Quite a fan favorite of the children who aspire to be knights. A giant, Kraken head shaped center piece made of gelatin with licorice tentacles draped over the edge of the body of water (punch bowl) it rests in.
Feast of the Earth,	 The Feast of the Earth is a traditional way of cooking a banquet of meat and vegetables by heating stones in a dugout pit with a fire, placing baskets of food on top of the stones, and covering everything with earth for several hours before uncovering the Feast of the Earth.
Troll meat,	 Notoriously difficult to wrangle and capture, a live troll acts as a festival centrepiece to certain warrior cultures. The regenerative properties of the beast can be exploited, providing a near-limitless supply of delectable meat to be cut from it.
Axebeak Gyros,	 During hunting festivals, the powerful hind legs of an axebeak are often cooked on a rotisserie or spit, served to joyous citizens wrapped in a flatbread, with fried tomato, onion, and tzatziki sauce.
Cockatrice Marrow,	 The bones of a cockatrice are filled with a thick marrow, quite unlike its avian physiology would suggest. It tastes exquisite, and is eaten to promote a relaxed body free of muscle pain and rigidness.
Stewed Bat and Vegetables,	 Bats are an omen of death, and are eaten whole to "scare death away". During cooking, bats have a strong odor similar to urine, so garlic, onion, chili pepper, or other aromatic ingredients are added during the process. It is sometimes of the Giant Bat variety, in which case the bat is sliced prior to being stewed.
Skyglass Wine,	 A clear, light blue liquid made in a unique distillation process using skyglass, a rare and magically reactive material. The secrets of its creation are viciously guarded by the Doreila family and their wineries in the Korian Desert, the only known area where skyglass can be found. Imbibing the wine infuses one with a small amount of residual magic that, when consumed in the right amounts, is said to enable one to see the flow of magic with their bare eyes. Drinking enough skyglass wine to become intoxicated (failing a CON save) forcibly casts Detect Magic on the user for one minute.
Goblin Floss,	 Liquorice Laces that make your teeth look yellow and rotten.
Bugbear Bowl,	 A "salad" composed mainly of beetles, caterpillars, spinach leaves and beef broth. Not quite the tastiest, but if you manage to eat a full serving, you get a pat-on-the-back from the vendor.
Hob-gobble-ins,	 Bite-sized spheres of salty bread with incredibly spicy meat inside. It's a common party game to race to eat as many as you can before you regurgitate it in a shower of meat, bread and hot flames.
